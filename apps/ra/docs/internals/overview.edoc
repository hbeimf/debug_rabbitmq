@title Ra
@doc `ra' is an implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm
([https://raft.github.io/]).
It allows users to write persistent, replicated and fault-tolerant
state machines by implementing the {@link ra_machine} behaviour.

The {@link ra} module provides the API for starting, stopping and deleting
Ra clusters, managing membership as well as interacting
with `ra_machine' implementations running inside `ra' clusters.
